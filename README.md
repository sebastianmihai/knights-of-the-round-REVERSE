# Reverse engineering Knights of the Round (arcade)

I created the Warlock's Tower edition of Knights of the Round (1991 arcade game, by Capcom) by first reverse engineering the original game (from binary), and then designing a series of modifications to craft a new experience. This was also a chance to learn Motorola 68000 assembly language.
